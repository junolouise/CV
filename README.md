## Katie Rodgers

My love of travel lead me to working for a travel company for several years, until one day I had the realisation that a lot of my job could have been carried out by a computer. This sparked my interest in coding. A month after coding in my spare time, I loved it so much that I quit my job and started studying at Makers Academy.

My time spent at Makers Academy has taught me the importance of best coding practices, and this is my biggest priority in looking for a junior developer role. I am looking for work in a supportive environment where those practices are followed.

I believe that in unity there is strength- I have become a part of the coding community in London, attending various meet-ups and conferences and founded my own organisation, the London Vegan Coders. I believe that teams work best when everyone is enabled to contribute to the best of their ability and have recieved comments from several individuals that I have worked with at Makers that I explained things in a way that allowed them to grasp concepts that they previously struggled with.

## Skills

#### High Achiever

- I dive deeper into any environment/ role I am faced with. For example, whilst at Makers I have also started the London Vegan Coders group. Whilst at University I was elected Environment and Ethics officer and also was an intern for the mayor as Low Carbon Entrepreneur.

#### Excellent Communicator

- As part of writing for the music website, Gigslutz, I have interviewed many artists and had to be sure to engage with them in a short space of time to produce great quality content. 

#### Enthusiastic

- In team projects at Makers I have kept team morale high by arranging team lunches. I do not shy away from difficult tasks such as volunteering to work as the Night Officer for Trailfinders to help clients around the globe on their travels often in difficult situations such as needing to fly home due to the death of a loved one or flight cancellations.
