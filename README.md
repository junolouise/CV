## Katie Rodgers

Software Engineer who is highly motivated and has commerical experience of the full cycle of software development. I am versitile and a quick learner.

I believe that in unity there is strength- I have become a part of the coding community in London, attending various meet-ups and conferences and founded my own organisation, the London Vegan Coders.

I believe that teams work best when everyone is enabled to contribute to the best of their ability and I received comments from team members at Makers that I explained things really well, in a way that allowed them to grasp concepts that they previously struggled with, such as using whiteboarding and my excellent communication skills to get across a new concept when working on the Notes App and explaining the MVC model.

## Skills

#### High Achiever

- I dive deeper into any environment/ role I am faced with. For example, whilst at Makers I have also started the London Vegan Coders group. Whilst at University I was elected Environment and Ethics officer and also was an intern for the Mayor of London as Low Carbon Entrepreneur.

#### Excellent Communicator

- As part of writing for the music website, [Gigslutz](http://www.gigslutz.co.uk/author/katie-rodgers/), I have interviewed many artists and had to be sure to engage with them in a short space of time to produce great quality content. 

#### Enthusiastic

- In team projects at Makers I kept team morale high by arranging team lunches. I do not shy away from difficult tasks such as volunteering to work as the Night Officer for Trailfinders to help clients around the globe on their travels often in difficult situations such as needing to fly home due to the death of a loved one or flight cancellations. 

## Projects

Selecting an ingredient shows relevant recipes from an API. Built in two weeks as a group. I kept a [blog](https://medium.com/@katierodgers95) to document our journey.
